      <p>
        In mid-April, we will be hosting a pre-hackathon event full of workshops &amp; hands-on-trainings hosted by
        participating sponsors. For an entire day, companies will be able to help students master the tools they will need
        to take their skills to the next level. This event will give sponsors a unique chance to show off their APIs and
        platforms to the very developers that will be competing in the hackathon itself.
        We call it HackingEDU Training Day.
        Not only will you give hundreds of skilled users experience with your solutions, you will also develop an in-depth
        understanding of how people really use your product through short surveys given during the workshops as well as
        at attendee sign in. In addition, you discover what tools programmers are currently using and where their actual
        skill levels are with various technologies. Best of all, the sessions will be recorded and made available as a
        webinar series for all hackathon attendees, so the reach will extend far beyond the event itself.
        Send in your best mentors, teachers, and techies to teach people what they really want to learn, because students
        are already lining up.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Market your API/platform to hundreds of developers</li>
        <li>Create brand loyalists that will use your tools at HackingEDU and future projects</li>
        <li>Host hands-on workshops that will also be recorded as a webinar series</li>
        <li>Measure skill levels of developers on specific parts of your API via a survey</li>
        <li>Find out where students struggle and excel with your API via a survey</li>
        <li>Give back to the community and support future developers</li>
      </ul>
