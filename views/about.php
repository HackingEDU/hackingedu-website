	        <h1>What is Hacking Edu?</h1>
	        <p>HackingEDU is helping students who are ready for a change.  Ready for a new approach to education than what is currently provided.  We want you and your team to bring a product to market that will catalyze a new age to education.  Something that will change the way we think about school. <strong>It is not required to create something related to education.</strong></p>

      	  	<p>We want the students to not only learn, but to show the world what new educational evolutions can be created to push our current system forward.  To inspire a new kind of educational system that works more effectively than the current one.</p>

      	  	<p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software.</p>

      	  	<h3><b>BUILD</b></h3>
      	  	<p>It's time to show what you've got!  They say ideas are great, but execution is where people fall short.  Lets see what you can do in the 36 hours provided.</p>
      	  	<br>
      	  	<h3><b>EVOLVE</b></h3>
      	  	<p>We believe that the current education system is outdated.  If you are on the same wavelength as us then lets make a change.  Let us evolve the way we think about education.</p>
