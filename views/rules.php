			 	        	<h3><b class="clr-green">IN A NUTSHELL...</b></h3>
			 	        	<p>Use common sense, and listen to HackingEDU staff. Let us know if you have any questions!</p>
			 	        	<h3><b class="clr-green">GENERAL</b></h3>
							<p>Rules are subject to change at any time without notice. Decisions by the HackingEDU team are final. Be sure to read our code of conduct.</p>
			 	        	<h3><b class="clr-green">PARTICIPATION</b></h3>
							<p>All participants must be full-time or part-time university students during Spring 2015 except where permission is explicitly given. (We’re willing to work with high school students — contact us). Participation is closed to family members of judges. Upon participation in this event, it is implied that we reserve the right to share your resume and other application material with our corporate sponsors.</p>
			 	        	<h3><b class="clr-green">TEAMS</b></h3>
							<p>Teams must consist of between 1 and 4 participants. Teams must submit a list of members upon submitting their hack by <span class="clr-green"><?php echo SUBMISSION_DATE; ?></span>. Any modifications after that must be approved by organizers. You can, by all means go solo, but we encourage you to work in groups!</p>
			 	        	<h3><b class="clr-green">SUBMISSIONS</b></h3>
							<p>Each team is permitted one submission that must be received by <span class="clr-green"><?php echo SUBMISSION_DATE; ?></span>. Code submitted must be produced only by team members and written during the HackingEDU <span class="clr-green"><?php echo HACK_EDU_LOCATION; ?></span> event from the starting time on <span class="clr-green"><?php echo START_DATE; ?></span> to the submission time. If you are continuing a previous project or using old code written by you, let us know on the project submission form. Third party libraries are allowed without notice provided that they are publicly available to any participant. All code you create at HackingEDU <span class="clr-green"><?php echo HACK_EDU_LOCATION; ?></span> is owned by you, and may be made open source at your discretion. By submitting a project, you and your team grant the HackingEDU team the unrestricted right to use your submission material, at no cost, for promotional purposes of future HackingEDU events.</p>
			 	        	<h3><b class="clr-green">JUDGING CRITERIA</b></h3>
							<p>Teams’ demos will be judged on several criteria including usefulness, technical difficulty, polish, and creativity. More details about the judging process will be provided closer to the event. Teams will not be told their scores during or after judging, and decisions by the judges and HackingEDU team are final.</p>
			 	        	<h3><b class="clr-green">PROJECT FAIR</b></h3>
							<p>At the end of the event, teams will showcase their projects in a project fair. During this time period, judges will proceed to all teams, and a team will have one to two minutes to demonstrate their projects in a project fair. A team’s presentation may be interrupted by a judge at any time. Teams must be ready to demo when the judges reach their table, and passing on a judge relinquishes the right to be judged. Corporate prizes are judged directly by the company, and HackingEDU is not responsible for the criteria used by these companies.</p>
			 	        	<h3><b class="clr-green">WINNERS</b></h3>
							<p>Winners for general HackingEDU prizes will be selected by a combination of corporate judges and judges provided by HackingEDU. Each winning team will be responsible for working with the HackingEDU team to arrange for the payment to be sent. Corporate prizes are judged by the respective company, and are provided directly from a company to the winning team. The winning team is responsible for all taxes associated with a prize.</p>
